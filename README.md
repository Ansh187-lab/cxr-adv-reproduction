## üìå Project Summary

This reproduction was conducted as part of the DL4H Spring 2025 course at the University of Illinois. The goal was to replicate the paper‚Äôs adversarial training method on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset using a DenseNet121 backbone.

---

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset

- **NIH ChestX-ray14** (subset of 1,000‚Äì2,000 images for training/evaluation)
- Preprocessed to size 224√ó224
- Images stored in `/data/images-224/`
- Labels from `nih_metadata.csv`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Requirements

- Python 3.11
- PyTorch ‚â• 2.0
- Torchvision
- NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, tqdm, matplotlib

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
